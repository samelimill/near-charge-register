## Description
For this project, I've built a simple scheduling tool by expanding upon a starter code of HTML and CSS via Javascript and jQuery.

The main function I added was storing tasks inputted by the user to local storage, and populating the correct fields with the saved tasks when the page is refreshed. In addition, the background color of each text field changes according to it's relation to the current hour - events in the past are in grey, the current hour are in red, and events in the future are in green. I also added some CSS to give the save buttons some feedback when used, as well as a bit of text appearing to confirm a save.
